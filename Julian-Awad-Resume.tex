\begin{rSection}{Projects \& Publications}

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Thesis}{September 2023 - April 2024}{Modelling a Relativistic Spacecraft Mission to Detect a Distant Primordial Black Hole Orbiting Our Sun}{}
\item Conducted an 8-month research project on modeling a relativistic spacecraft mission to detect a primordial black hole (PBH) hypothesized to orbit our sun.
\item Synthesized the current literature on the Planet 9 hypothesis and constraints on its location and orbital parameters.
\item Developed a comprehensive model of thermal emissions from accreted matter around the hypothesized Planet 9 PBH, incorporating Bondi's spherical accretion theory.
\item Optimized mission parameters for cost-efficiency and speed using the Breakthrough Starshot initiative framework, aiming to propel spacecraft to relativistic speeds of up to 0.2c.
\item Estimated the number of spacecraft required for a conclusive search for Planet 9 by calculating the effective search radius and subdividing the probable location in the sky.
\item Analyzed the economic feasibility of the mission, including capital expenditure for ground stations and per-mission energy costs.

\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Publication}{September 2021 - December 2021}{An Investigation of Magnetic Radiation Shields for Human Space Habitats}{Awad et al.}
\item Designed and conducted an experiment over 6 weeks to measure the viability of a superconducting magnet as an active shield from radiation, GCRs, and lunar regolith for lightweight space travel applications.
\item Manufactured a vacuum chamber with a cooling tube configuration, wire feed-through, and a beta particle detector capable of maintaining a vacuum of 0.1 Pa to minimize particle stopping power and reduce condensation.
\item Designed superconducting magnet configurations made of superconducting YBCO tape with a vacuum-tight cooling system to maintain critical temperatures of 77K.
\item Created a Python program to perform in-depth analysis of the raw data, including noise filtering, curve fitting, and extrapolation to demonstrate clear trends.
