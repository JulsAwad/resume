\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{Rocket Lab (Sinclair Interplanetary)}{January 2023 - August 2023}{Mechanical Engineering Intern}{}

\item Redesigned and prototyped the entire mechanical assembly of the 1000Nms reaction wheel, leading to significant improvements in manufacturability, ease of assembly, and performance.
\item Analysed and characterized the magnetic field two different rotor magnetic arrays to determine optimal placement of hall sensors, resulting in an increase in measurement reliability.
\item Assembled, inspected and tested to the highest available industry standards several satellite components currently operating on orbit.
\item Designed and manufactured 7+ Ground Support Equipment to aid in testing, manufacturing, inspection, and assembly across all departments.

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{rSubsection}{MDA}{May 2022 - December 2022}{Mechanical Engineering Intern}{}

\item Automated the entire end-to-end testing infrastructure for the CANADARM2 using Python, Pandas, and NumPy for efficient parsing, analysis and visualization of test data, leading to 10x time savings.
\item Building a custom DAQ system using LabVIEW to be used in several testing scenarios, including up to 20 load cells, 10 LVDTs, and 8 thermocouples.
\item Performing structural testing and analysis for Lunar Gateway Grapple Fixtures and End Effectors to characterize the stiffness of the latched assembly in all directions.
\item Performing end-to-end control systems test campaigns for the CANADARM2 using HITL/SITL simulations.
\item Defining system requirements for the GERS project (Lunar Gateway/CANADARM3) using PTC Windchill.

\begin{rSubsection}{Co-Lead Propulsion Engineer}{September 2022 - Present}{Queen's Rocket Engineering Team}{}
\item Designing the team's first student-built Hybrid Rocket Engine to reach an apogee of 10,000ft and compete at two international events against 150+ other schools.
\item Writing a Python simulation to numerically model the turbulent boundary layer and fuel regression dynamics, allowing for the prediction and optimization of performance metrics such as thrust, chamber pressure, and specific impulse.
\item Managing a team of 15+ engineering students to accomplish a hot-fire test through efficiently delegating tasks, providing learning resources, and maintaining deadlines while giving members autonomy and ownership of their work.
\item Created Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) documentation in LaTeX for the safe operation of a cold-flow and hot-fire test, complete with hazard assessment, risk mitigation, and contingency planning
\end{rSubsection}
\end{comment}

\begin{rSubsection}{Lockheed Martin}{May 2021 - August 2021}{Hardware Engineering Intern}{}

\item Performed detailed SolidWorks FEA analysis to validate equipment to Military Standard 901D
\item Created an Excel VBA tool to generate shock response spectra from an impulse function for shock \& vibe testing, resulting in a user-friendly program
\item Accomplished overall 2x cost reduction and 4x time savings by performing detailed make-vs-buy analysis on electronics enclosures and presenting to senior engineers

\end{rSubsection}

\begin{comment}
\begin{rSubsection}{Department of National Defense - Engineering Intern}{May 2020 - September 2020}{}{}
