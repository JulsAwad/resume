%	WORK EXPERIENCE
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Experience}

\begin{rSubsection}{MDA - Mechanical Engineering Intern}{May 2022 - Present}{}{}

\item Performing end-to-end control systems test campaigns for the CANADARM2 using HITL/SITL simulations.
\item Programmed custom Python tools to convert raw test logs into actionable data and rich visual elements to automate test requirement validation, leading to a 10X increase in time efficiency.
\item Created 2 custom LabVIEW DAQ VIs to seamlessly interface with various sensors such as thermocouples and load cells and process the data collected automatically.
%\item Created over 10 different automated data parsing and analysis tools using Python, Pandas, and NumPy for efficient analysis and visualization of test data, accomplishing week-long tasks within minutes.
\item Responsible for every step of 20+ test cases in 6 kinematic modes, including configuring the hardware/software testbench, writing test scripts, parsing and analysing data, and interpretation of results.
\item Defining system requirements for the Lunar Gateway/CANADARM3 project using PTC Windchill
