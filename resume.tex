\begin{rSubsection}{Undergraduate Research Project}{September 2021 - December 2021}{An Investigation of Magnetic Radiation Shields for Human Space Habitats}{Awad et al.}
\item Designed and conducted an experiment over 6 weeks to measure the viability of a superconducting magnet as an active radiation shield for lightweight space travel applications
\item Manufactured a vacuum chamber with a cooling tube configuration, wire feed-through, and a beta particle detector capable of maintaining a vacuum of 0.1 Pa to minimize particle stopping power and reduce condensation on the superconductor
\item Designed and created superconducting magnet configurations made of cutting-edge YBCO tape with a vacuum-tight cooling system to maintain critical temperatures of 77K
\item Created a Python program to perform in-depth analysis of the raw data, including noise filtering, curve fitting, and extrapolation to demonstrate clear trends
